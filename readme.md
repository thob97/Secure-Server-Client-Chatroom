# abgesicherter Server Chatraum

Project for the Rechnersicherheit course. The objective is to develop a server that allows clients to connect via CLI (Command Line Interface). The clients should be able to register an account, log in to their account, send private and global messages, as well as exchange files. Security is a crucial aspect of this project, ensuring the safety of both the server and the communication between clients and the server.

To achieve this, various security techniques have been employed. For instance, hashed, salted, and peppered passwords were utilized to enhance password security. Secure functions and algorithms were carefully selected and implemented, and encrypted communication channels were established. Additionally, the entire setup has been containerized using Docker, enabling platform-independent testing and deployment.
